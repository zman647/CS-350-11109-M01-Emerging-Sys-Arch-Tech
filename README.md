1. The problem this project solves is creating a smart thermostat prototype usning a Texas Instruments CC3220SF-LaunchXL development board. It is desinged to read the room temperature via a TMP006 temperature sensor.
2. I believe my debugging process for connecting and flashing my board is the part I did best, as I was originally experiencing an error preventing me from sucessfully beginning the loop on the board and starting I2C.
3. I could have improved my schedule by starting it early, or doing more research on common hardware errors to better understand why my board was possibly having issues staying connected to my pc.
4. Things I have added to my support network are Code Composure Studio, TI Resource Explorer, and I2C, GPIO, and UART protocols.
5. Transferable skills include Embedded Systems Programming, real-time Data handling, task scheduling, debugging(When my board functioned), code documentation and peripheral configuration.
6. I made the project maintainable, readable, and adaptable by applying modularity to divide functions and commentation.
